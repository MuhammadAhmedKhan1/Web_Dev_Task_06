<h1>Quiz Page - README</h1>

  <p>This project is a simple quiz page created using HTML. It provides a basic structure for a multiple-choice quiz with three questions. The form includes radio buttons for answer choices and a submit button. Currently, this quiz does not validate answers, as it is designed for HTML-only demonstration purposes.</p>

  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Three multiple-choice questions</li>
    <li>Radio buttons for answer options</li>
    <li>Submit button for the quiz form</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Project Structure</h2>
  <p>The quiz page is structured using the following HTML elements:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>&lt;form&gt;</strong> - Wraps the entire quiz form and prepares it for submission.</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;fieldset&gt;</strong> - Groups each question into a separate section for better organization.</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;legend&gt;</strong> - Provides a title for each question.</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;input type="radio"&gt;</strong> - Allows the user to select one answer per question.</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;label&gt;</strong> - Improves usability by making each answer option clickable.</li>
    <li><strong>&lt;button&gt;</strong> - Provides a submit button to send the form (though no backend processing is included).</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Usage</h2>
  <p>To use this quiz page:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Open the HTML file in a web browser.</li>
    <li>Select one answer per question by clicking on the radio buttons.</li>
    <li>Click the "Submit Quiz" button to submit your answers (no actual processing will occur, as there is no backend).</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Future Enhancements</h2>
  <p>This project could be enhanced by adding JavaScript to validate the answers, display scores, or improve the user interface with CSS styling.</p>
